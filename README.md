# Employee Turnover Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes employee turnover within an organization using data visualization and statistical techniques. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition, which can help in developing strategies to improve employee retention.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Data visualization using various plots and charts
- Feature engineering to create new variables
- Logistic regression model to predict employee attrition
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Future Improvements

1. **Incorporate more data sources**: Integrate additional data sources like employee surveys, performance reviews, and demographic information to enrich the analysis.

2. **Implement advanced machine learning models**: Experiment with more sophisticated models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to improve prediction accuracy.

3. **Develop a web application**: Create a user-friendly web application that allows HR managers to input employee data and receive insights and predictions about turnover.

4. **Conduct sensitivity analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential factors contributing to employee turnover and prioritize interventions accordingly.

5. **Implement a recommendation system**: Develop a recommendation system that suggests personalized retention strategies for each employee based on their risk of leaving the organization.
